The Cheesy Wrap was great and was filled with cheese in every bite. The Chicken Jumbo Wrap actually had loads of chicken with my favorite variety being the chicken meatball. This is definitely a must try and is also a part of their Signature Wraps.",

I placed an order for half kg mocha walnut cake. The order was taken over call and rest of the communication like what message is to be written on cake etc was done on whatsapp. When I called the next day to collect the cake, they could not find my order. I had to call multiple times and finally I was told my order is ready. Upon reaching the outlet, the message was not written on the cake and they hurriedly packed a cake and gave me. When I asked them if this is really mocha walnut, they said yes you can see the walnut on the cake. They even had no idea of how much payment is remaining or how much I have already paid. Upon reaching home when the cake was cut, we realised it is not mocha walnut but butterscotch!! The outlet cheated me and so I called them and blasted over phone. I reached the outlet at 10:30 pm at night and slammed the cake in the store and demanded my money back, I was paid back the amount but the experience was terrible and bitter specially because it was a b'day cake. The store management is pathetic and there is no coordination or even an ounce of professionalism in them. Never ever going back and I strictly recommend anyone to go at their own risk.

Only to find out they had removed the ice cube which had the hair. After quite a discussion they brought the executive chef ( who literally just stood there with absolutely no contribution to the discussion) eventually when one of the staff's members (nandu in the photo) asserted that he'll personally pay for it we asked for the owner's contact, who then waived off the bill.

The best part is the freshly baked breads. Those beautiful, soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter. Even the puffs and Victoria cake are nice to have.Coming to the worst part - the service. In all my visits over the past couple of months, this has been the biggest turn off about this place. Almost always, I had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over. Second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating.

We went there around 1 p.m. and it was very hot, so we opted for sitting indoor.We tried many cakes, cookies and doughnuts here and I liked most of them but my favorite are:a) Red Velvet Doughnut [Rs.60] which was freshly baked and was stuffed with gooey cream filling.b) Salted Nutella Doughnut [Rs.75] which was very soft and stuffed with Nutella.c) Banana Cake [Rs.155] which was moist, soft and cake like sweet bread.d) Dark Chocolate Cookie [Rs.50] which was once again very soft but was not too sweet.epicureantales.com\t4.0\t6/28/2018 0:14\t\u00e0 \u00e9viter d'urgence\tLe Lotus Bleu\tHospitality and service: 4\t2019-04-24\tGyoza;Gyoza;Curry Laksa\t63.88\t19\t22\tNo\u00e9 Hernandez\tAvis mensonger\nThe restaurant is good, food is good.

        "commentaire": "Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker! The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!Take my word, Hyderabadi Daawat serves, authentic Hyderabadi food!",

        "commentaire": "'Say no more!'Food - The name itself will get any Hyderabadis taste buds jiggle! And certainly it stood up to it's name, the food here was delectable!I'll list out my favorites first, In the starters I just fell in love with the Murgh Kalmi Kebab, chicken leg pieces marinated in not so spicy mixture, it was delicious and it is a #musttry on my list! I jumped ahead a lil without mentioning the soup because murgh kalmi was magical, likewise Yakhni Shorba (Indianized Mutton Soup) was a great way to get things started! It had the perfect balance of flavours and that subtle amount black pepper does a great job! Sabz Ki Shaami, a mashed vegetable mixture, fried in oil, served with mayonnaise and mint chutney was a good light vegetarian starter. Paneer Achari Kebab wasn't the softest and also the sides were burnt a lil so they need to work on this, otherwise the flavor is pretty good! Gosht Sheekh Kebab, a classic, the salt levels were perfect and the meat was really tender, felt it was a bit dry though. Patrani Fish, wrapped inside a banana (I'm guessing) leaf, was topped with a layer of mint chutney, although the fish was heavenly, I'd love it to be served without the layering of the chutney! Tandoori Jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second #musttry starter!The drinks got mixed reactions! Well 60% of them being below average and another 40% being extraordinary, it was a rollercoaster in this dept.! We gave the review to the management regarding the basic ones and soon after that they presented us Cinderella, Caramel Mint Mojito and Mint Cooler which just blew us all away! I hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktails as well!The main course had us dying! We were already so full and there was plenty of food left! Gosht Achari, Murgh Achari, the former being a lil more spicier, were just classic dishes being served and when you combine them with nicely done butter naans, there's nothing better than this combination! Nargisi Kofta was another curry, couldn't differentiate much when compared to the other two.Special mention goes to 'Sikendari Raan' for \u20b91490, it was a treat to watch this magnificent charred leg piece of a lamb on a plate with oozing juices and scrumptious sides! If you're a lamb lover then it is something that'll satisfy all your Mutton cravings! Food gets a solid 10/10! Need to work on the drinks though!Ambiance - It is a huge property just opposite to SLN Terminus. With ground and first floor seating, it has plenty of space to fill in atleast 130 people at once! Although the place is well lit, I didn't feel anything special being around because right now and always theme based restaurants will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well lit place with good furniture! 'Hyderabadi Daawat' should incorporate anything and everything Hyderabad has to offer in it's culture as nobody else in that area are doing that! I had crazy ideas like making the waiters wear a classic Lungi, have Marfa (Hyderabadi Band Baaja) outside on the weekends, but the classy interiors just don't allow this to happen! Well you never know, I'm not saying that place is bad but they have to add an element of joy! Ambiance gets 8/10!Service - It was decent! As they're pretty fresh in the market, they'll have to work rigorously to improvise according to the customers taste! The food arrived in an ample time and the table was being cleared every now and then! I'd like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual names the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order! The waiters, butlers need to push the specials everyday rather than just leaving it on the vast menu they have! Overall service gets 8/10!Why Hyderabadi Daawat? #authenticWill I Specially go to HD? Sometimes :)",

Hyderabadi Daawat does justice to it's name but treating us to good Hyderabadi food.The restaurant is located on the Gachibowli - Kondapur mainroad with convenient parking. The interiors are classy and comfortable.The dish that started off the Daawat was the Yakhni Shorbha which was meticulously done - spicy, meaty and the meat was literally falling apart from the bone.Achari paneer - seasoned with pickle masalas and was just cooked to perfection.Sabz ki Shami - the textures felt a little strange to me.Tandoori Aaloo- soft and fluffy stuffed potatos with crispy grilled skins on the exteriorMurgh Kalmi kebab - marinated chicken in mild spices grilled to perfection in a tandoor.Gosht Seekh Kebab- it is extremely easy to dry out a Seekh Kebab but they nail it here.Patrani fish and tandoori Jhinga needed a improvement as they lacked depth of flavour and taste.Their main course comprised of Murgh Mussalam, Nargisi Kofta, Achari Murgh, Shahi Paneer, Dal Akbari, Gosht Masala.Their Sikandari Raan and Murgh Mussalam deserve a special mention.A variety of mocktails are available out of which my personal favourites happen to be the Lemon mint cooler, Cinderella ( slightly on the sweeter side) and Coco Baliney.Their service was exceptional where the minutest details were taken care of.",

I liked the achari paneer tikka in starters. Shahi paneer was my favourite among the main course that went well with their mix roti Basket. Two of my favourite beverages from the evening were Caramel Mojito and Lemon Mint.The menu is vast and really reasonable. Do not miss this place if you like Hyderabadi cusinie.

        "commentaire": "I have always been a fan of regional cuisines of India for their immense depth in terms of culture as well as tradition. And its not just the flavours on the taste buds, its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization. And with the imprint Nizams have left on the city of Hyderabad in every aspect, it doesn't even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in Hyderabadi cuisine.Hyderabadi Dawaat is one new joint in Gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of Nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite Hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights.Coming to the food, I went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba which was a flavour-pumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal. With every sip, the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue.Then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg. From the vegetarian ones, I personally loved the Achaari Paneer Tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it. From the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the Murgh Kalmi Kebab - chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection, Gosht Seekh Kebab - plain old mutton kebabs with juicy, succulent mutton mince and Patrani Fish - fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade, wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor.From among the specialties from the area, the restaurant presented us with their Sikandari Rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, pepper and cashew nut, finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage - tender, juicy and delicious. In a similar fashion, restaurant also serves specialty big platters like Chelo Kebabs which is a Persion styled serving of Mutton and Chicken Kebabs on a bed of Saffron Rice and Murg Mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender, served again on a bed of rice.Even after the Rann, the show wasn't over and we went in for mains trying out their Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which went really well with some hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. Nargisi Kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy onion-tomato gravy. Gosht Masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the Kofta and had flavourful bone-in mutton pieces. With the Achari Chicken, the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish wasn't too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be. Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note, both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good.The service here at Hyderabadi Dawaat was just as good as their food. The staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates. I was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best. In a nutshell, if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of Hyderabad on a plate, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list!instagram.com",

They have turned this up to a multi cuisne serving hyderabadi , mughlai , oriental and a bit of continental. We though here were just to try the mughlai , a bit of hyderabadi and a little north Indian style of food.

        "commentaire": "Hyderabadi Cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the tradition(s) like any other cuisine. Generations after generation, the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such. But there is more than just biryani and kebab(s). Once you get to taste real authentic dishes, you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of Nizams. You always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the Cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies. Wait no more as kondapur-gachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while. Hyderabadi Daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebab(s) and biryani. My dinner session today had no expectation(s) from it but then the food spoke for itself. Restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you don't get that easily anywhere in vicinity.Dishes like #MurghMussalam , #MurghKalmiKebab, #CheloKebab, #PatraniFish, #GoshtMasala, #SikanderRaan and many more. While a few dishes went amiss to excite me, all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that's used to typical tandoor/kebab(s). Must Try : #AchariChicken, #GoshtMasala, #KalmiKebab, #PaneerAchari, #DalAkbari and #NargasiKoftaDo focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and I'm sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich Hyderabadi Daawat Cuisine. I'm definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service (Mainly Mr. Dilawar was so gracious)#GastroHogger #LetsHog #HyderabadiDawaat #DawaatDelicacies #CyberabadCelebrationsgastrohogger.com",

Earned a 1/2 star!Ordered Pathar-Gosht and Afghan Kebab as wanted to start off light. As surprising as it can be the Afghan Kebab turned to be the way an authentic kebab should be and not the imitation ones that are spread across cities. Pathar-Gosht was mouth watering as the aroma of the spices was blended perfectly and not to forget the accurate chunk sized that melted right away in the mouth. Another Star earned for Starters.When in Hyd go for Biryani- So how couldn't we as we ordered Biryanis - Chicken and Mutton. Prompt service by the staff ensured we had them served on our plats without much waiting time !Taste was good as they took care that the Biryani don't fry away our taste buds or bring tears down eye. Happy to have tasted an amazing blend of aroma and well coked mutton n chicken pieces. Spices were evenly distributed and the texture was smooth and appealing. The colours of the rice was perfectly blended as it reflected the Typical Hyderabadi style.With tummies full we ordered Blue Mojito and it too scored as expected...Amazing. Time for a wrap up as the Manager Mr. Dilawar greeted us with his hospitality. A true Gentleman he was as he assisted my family all throughout.My View: An amazing yet serene restaurant to visit with Family and friends. Located conveniently in Main road to Gachibowli, Daawat is a must try if you're around or visiting Hyd. When in Daawat- don't forget to try their Pathar-Gosht and not to forget the Amazing Raan they boast of being their super speciality.Food: 4*Ambiance 4.5 *Budget Friendly : 4*Staff Hospitality: 5*Happy Fooding !",

The Dimsum food festival had a variety of Thukpa options ranging from Chicken, Mutton, Pork and the veg version alongside some beautifully crafted dimsums inspired from China. Next up, there was an option for various wok tossed gravies and some delicious desserts.The first thing to try out was their Chicken Thukpa. It was simply delicious. The broth was super special and it had a balanced proportion of sweet, spice and tang into it which was amazing. The amount of veggies and noodles were also quite balanced and overall, it was an absolute winner. This was something I personally recommend all of you to try.Next up, we were offered some of their Dimsums. The showstopper of the day were Pan fried Chicken Gyoza, Pok choi roasted garlic and Napa Cabbage Crystals, Prawn crystal wraps and Vegetable beijing dumpling. The Prawn crystal wraps had a tad sweet soy used as a sauce which could have had a slight more kick to it otherwise all these are a must try.For mains, we ordered for Wok tossed Chicken in Dry chilli cashews, Crispy fish in chilli plum sauce along side Vegetable fried rice and Vegetable wok tossed soft noodles. The Chicken in dry chilli cashwes was the clear winner of the lot and was simply wonderful. It was a tad saltier in the first serving but we got it amended thanks to the chef. Overall, the main course was good and had clean, authentic flavors.With out tummies full and our satisfaction levels reached, we decided to go ahead with their Toffee banana with palm sugar ice cream. This was magical. I have been a lover of Toffee banana but this fusion right here was mind blowing. The creaminess of the palm sugar ice cream went on fantastically with the crispy banana toffee and was a big boost for our palate.All in all, it is a place to sit back, relax and enjoy a great layout of Pan Asian food. The staff is highly cooperative and seeks a lot of feedback which is a great thing. Happy eating. :)",

Ambience was just ok as it was too dull according to me. The highlight of this place is its open till late night 2 am and has an amazing roof top.We order 1 veg and 3 non veg starters and all were perfectly done. Specially mention for Butter garlic fish (if u like buttery flavour) which was just superb.The only thing which I didn\u2019t like was the portion size which was too less.And yes you get booze served here even on dry days \ud83d\ude09",

First of all, the ambiance comes alive in the night with a lounge like feel, and even the otherwise boring corporate concrete jungle around seems better in the night from a height. I am guessing they put their best efforts on a weekend compared to weekdays as the food quality was significantly better. Food order was two varieties of veg sushis (the crispy one was very well made), soft noodles, and a coconut based Thai curry (which was neither too sweet nor heavy on the stomach, very well made overall). And the place was quite packed as well making it lively. Overall, worth visiting.",

The menu is sorted, right from starters to main course to desserts! We ordered slowly cooked lamb, freshly prepared chicken and shrimp... These were from the chef's menu!!

Best hot and sour soup on par with any Chinatown joint across the world - bamboo shoots, shiitake mushroom and all the works. Gyoza is good. Heck everything they served was good on my second visit. Special shoutout to the lady who mixes the drinks - a true professional. Her Nirvana cocktail is just that - sinful pleasure. I went there on consecutive weekends. Tip - go during the day because it is well lit and has a wonderful view outside. I will be there again. Cost is very reasonable for the place which is a very pleasant surprise. I will be there again for some more of the Nirvana potion.",

I would rate this place 4/5 for food beacuse the fried rice that we have ordered, though it was tasty it is oily. For the service this would deserve 5/5 because from the time I've entered I was heartfully welcomed by the hostess and was shown a proper place for seating. And the bar man was so interactive with us which actually misses in other bars. When I have to write about the ambience, this place deserves a bow. Ambience inside the bar is awesome but the ambience from the rooftop would be mind blowing. Would love to go there again and again.",

It's like drinking alcohol and having good food and finding out you paid extra which you could have saved if you would have gone to a similar place with much less to spend. 900 rs for a glass of wine ? Well not worth going twice specially if other places are serving the same wine for 400 a glass.But if you're a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this.DJ plays some really nice music.And one advantage is that this place is opened till 2 am.",

Nice and courteous waiting with quick service.However, the security of the hotel (Sheraton) in which this marvellous diner was in, did not know that the hotel even had a restaurant called Zega. Also, there's no elevator from the underground parking space.It was a 5 star experience for the restaurant, the ambience and the food. But I cannot say the same for the convenience at the main entrance.Anyway. It's a must visit. I apologise for the 4 stars it easily deserves a 5.

Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7-8 min, whereas in any other 5 star, a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry. However we went inside and opted for a buffet. The food spread was very good however, few of them were cold(roast chkn and fish tikka). The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert. The most annoying thing was the on the table service. The table wasnt ready when we were seated. We had to ask for napkin, spoon, fork and even for a glass of water. Multiple times. The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean. The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star.",

Their food was something that we thoroughly enjoyed. we had their awesome tyangra style hakka fired prawns which was sweet and mildly spicy. there were about 6 chunky prawns in a plate. Their Maki salmon sushi was great as well if not the best. Then we had the Chinese barbecue Pork belly ribs which was chunky, succulent and juicy. in short, we had a really great meal and look forward to a second visit there soon.",

Packing was perfect and it reached my home hot and fresh. Both the types of parathas were really crumptious. Even the green chutney they serve with this was awesome.

The aloo parantha was excellent. The corn cheese parantha was good too but i couldn't find any cheese in that parantha. I guess i would never order corn and cheese parantha again.

They actually kept the Punjabi paratha feel alive so thank you for doing total justice to the food you serve.A small complaint would be adding more aloo and not make the dough too thick, but overall, it was wonderful. And just like a true Punjabi, I even burped thrice after having this meal. Paisa Vasool!",

We reached there by 7:30 and we were the first customers, by 8:30 onwards people started to fill the restaurant. It\u2019s not difficult to find the place since is on the main road.Ambiance is nice, the typical chinese music that goes on is kind of relaxing. Decors have chinese items so it\u2019s not bad.Service was spot on, we were attended very. It didn\u2019t take much time for the food to come out from the kitchen.For food we had Satay Chicken sticks and Spicy Black Bean Lamb for starters, Teppan Soba Noodles Sizzler for main course and cheesecake for desserts. The satay chicken was so tender that immediately fell from the skewers and melted in the mouth, really good. The Lamb was good but not wow. The noodles tasted awesome! It came sizzling, buttery and full of flavour. Usually in India is hard to find a decent cheesecake but for our surprise this one was really good so really a good culinary experience. The prices are a bit on the higher side but deserves a try definitely. Recommend!Food 5/5Ambiance 4/5Service 5/5Value 3/5",

Lemon, coriander, and chillies have all added to the flavors. The crispy water chestnut starter is sweet but tasty. I could not stop myself from finishing the sweet coriander sauce that had a hint of mint.Teppan soba noodles, a sizzler, is just as good. All in all, a happy experience!Will I visit again: Yes!Cost effectiveness: Average. About 700 for a person.Experience enhancers: The staff who are well aware of how the food is made. Very nice service",

The manchurian isn't the desi version that you get in most places so the spice levels can be a let down. But the noodles were thin and light. Overall a delicious meal. Definitely recommend it!",

The sweet corn soup was good and thick and tastes delicious with all vegetables. He veg mini dragons are mini spring rolls that kind of disappointed me as they were very oily. May be it's my personal choice but I wish they are less oily. The haka noodles were the best I have had and loved them to the core. I gave full points because the staff is very friendly and super courteous and the service was also very good.",

We didn't like starters; Honey potato was too much on sweeter side than it should be & Babycorn starter has no taste (No salt, No spice). But again Main course specially Egg fried rice was very nice & tasty (could have ordered a bit more spicy one; bcoz it was infromed to us when ordering about the spice level but we ignored, so no complaints). Over all good experience, but spicy levels are far less :)Ambience - 4/5Cleanliness - 5/5Service - 5/5Food (starters) - 2/5Food (Main course) - 4/5Tip: Do check for spicy levels before ordering!!",

We ordered veg soup and chicken manchow soup they were good. But if you see the attached image to this review, the cucumber and salad, which i got was not fresh and this had disappointed me. You would expect fresh food on your table, when you pay premium price.We then ordered garlic based noodles (cant remember the name), mongolian chicken and lime soda. The food was great but again, we found the mushrooms in the noodles not fresh and this made me quiet disappointed.Overall i would say the food was great, a bit pricey though.

The food was exactly what we wanted wait sorry let me correct myself, it was way better than what we wanted.Our order came in around 15 min ( maybe lesser ) and it consisted of crispy lamb, noodles saut\u00e9ed in this wonderful butter garlic combination!!, mixed fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce!! The food was exceptionally good ! Each dish was gourmet level and to top it all of we had desserts which was darsaan and ice cream ( the best darsaan I've ever had ).Food and service was mind blowing. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and anyone who wishes to have Chinese. And yes this place is going to become my second house, you'll see me here way too often from today",

I am a huge fan of Indo-Chinese cuisine and I honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment. I ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side. Hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there's no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the Chinese food. Wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren't properly fried and rather than giving a good taste, it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering. All in all, the food wasn't enjoyable. Will I visit again? Probably not! I am sorry! Thanks!",

        "commentaire": "#Delayedpost (date of visit Jan 10)#FoodShaukeen #ChinesePavilionChinese Pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in Chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a Chinese restaurant, and I wasted no time in suggesting this \ud83d\ude09. Visited Gachibowli branch which is above CCD and is in the same building of Up the Bistro.Their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to 40 pax comfortably.Pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above 350 and very few are between 250 - 350 . A tummyful meal could go up to 1400 for 2 AI.Have ordered Manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds. Red Chilli Prawns (dry), BBQ chicken, three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers. Prawns Teppan yaki, pan fried and tossed along with Chilli Garlic and butter tasted real good. BBQ chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better. Show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish, a wonderful combo to your taste buds. Three treasure veggies had broccoli, baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me. Had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces, could have done wonders.Among main course was schezwan fried rice and CP special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce, tasted Okish as sauce did not impress me as much as I expected. Schezwan rice was delicious though, right to the spices. Requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles \ud83d\ude15.Service : Though their service is quick, staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order. Something that is important from customer point of view.Bottomline : there were few misses and few hits. However, most of the dishes were towards sweeter side. I wouldnt mind another try here and see if my first visit is just an exception.",

        "commentaire": "Amazing food,good ambience & great service...this is what describes Chinese Pavilion. Their Chinese is blended in Indian flavors & that is what makes it so special! The chopsuey,all chicken non veg gravies are worth trying here along with fish/prawn starters. The best part about their food is it isn't bland,it is mixed with Indian flavors ensuring the Chinese name stays to it preventing it to be less spicy. If you want to try something different within the Chinese cuisine this place won't disappoint you. And the service is awesomely good as the servers there wont just serve you with a smile but also recommend their best dishes and can even customise your dishes as per your choice. I am going with a 4.5 because I beliebe the efforts put by their team should be appreciated and I request every foodie to visit this place. This is honestly one of the few Chinese places that serve chinese cuisine with an Indian touch. Worth a visit any day!",

One of the most simple yet complicated in flavor profiles. India has also embraced so much of Asian cuisine that you can vouch that most of Indian Foodie community next to their regional cuisine would be fans of Chinese Cuisine. Chinese Pavilion is one of the most consistent brand in Hyderabad that you keep hearing for authentic no non-sense Chinese dishes at not to alarming prices and yet have strong fan following.  I for one of them was a fan as I dined here last year and fate had me to dine her with Fellow Foodie Bhais exactly after a year and I had to be blown away by the food only to believe that no wonder this place has been awarded The Best Chinese Restaurant 2016 from Times Of India .

Restaurant is located near the Gachibowli highway on the 1st floor above CCD. Restaurant had nice interiors and we were greeted in a warm manner. The staffs were very courteous to explain us the dish details at the time of order. We ordered for POTATO BALL HONEY PEPPER SA, DUMPLINGS, VEGETABLE MANCHURIAN, VEGETABLE BLACK BEAN NOODLES, 3 TREASURE VEG CHILLY. All Dishes were served spontaneously and all were almost authentic chinese dishes. There was no soup provided along with dumplings as is provided in Kolkata shops. We were disappointed with Manchurian as they were too much salty. Noodles were perfectly cooked but the babycorns needed to be boiled a bit. Overall a wonderful experience as we spent more than 2 hours eating n chitchatting with friends. We also had cakes which we brought from outside. They were very much cooperative to allow us outside food.TASTE 3.1/5SERVICE 5/5PRICE 4/5. There is NO SERVICE CHARGE ON THE BILL.",

So, when I heard that they have opened another restaurant in Gachibowli which is near to my home, I was excited and took my family to dinner. First of all, the ambience is a huge let down. It looked like any budget restaurant and I was thinking whether I should get out or go in. Finally, went in expecting some great food.We ordered noodles, fried rice, a lamb dish and a brownie. First of all, the prices were exorbitant for the ambience and the overall experience. They are providing a 3* experience and asking for 4*/5* prices. The fired rice was great but the lamb was undercooked. The desert was a disaster. Overall, please avoid this restaurant. I am not sure what is the condition of their Banjara Hills branch now but there are far better Chinese eateries around Gchibowli as well.",

These things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out.Now food - Jade chicken soup, nice spinach based creamy stuff, gud way to start the meal. Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi, nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good. Fish cakes were good, loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome. Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn, well that was the downer. Nothing exciting abt it, maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash, fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry. Desert - blue berry cheesecake, so here is where me and wifey differ, I thght it was worth it, she says the base wasn't crunchy engh. So try and rate yourself.Last ambience - was warm n eye soothing.Oh and I forgot, the orange pekoe tea, the best I had in lat few months. Have it",

        "commentaire": "Bad rating is mainly because of \"Chicken Bone found in Veg food\" and is not acceptable for a Vegetarian.To satiate Cravings for chinese food we headed to Chinese Pavilion and there was also a voucher available in Little app for Luncheon tray for Rs 310 (Veg) [well do not bother for the voucher as the price for Veg Luncheon tray is Rs 275/- + taxes in the restaurant itself).The ambiance is decent and since it was noon, not many tables occupied so it was pretty quite.It was Thrusday special (Veg):Hot and Sour soup: was just OK - well it had sprouts which were crunchy in your mouth: something different.Kimchi - salad (personally i'm never fond of it)Potato in plum sauce - this was very good and well madeBrocolli, Baby corn, Mushroom in spicy sauce - this dish lived to its name 'too spicy'; but was fine with fried riceVeg hakka noodles - was goodVeg fried riceOverall the food tasted good until a piece of chicken BONE came into my friend's (he is pure vegetarian) mouth while eating noodles. It was such a disappointment and complete experience was ruined.Well Management did apologise but surely they cannot put things correct and were offering of not using coupon but we surely don't want to visit the place again. I requested to see their kitchen if they really segregate pans for Veg/Non-veg cooking which Manager declined which makes me believe they don't.Staff and service are fine but they really need to improve the segregation of Veg and Non-veg as in Indian Culture it means a lot.Uploaded photos with the bone found.",

The entrance has some carvings and the walls were very nicely decorated. The server was very politeWhen it comes to food this place does not disappoint.This is a small/comfy restaurant that is surprisingly not very crowded even on weekends. We went there for our anniversary celebrations and it was just perfect. No crowd, we got the attention and service we were looking for.",

Thereafter luncheon tray had came with pepper chicken starter, kimchi (salad), wolly chicken, egg fried rice and egg hakka noodles.. Taste is fine and didn't liked eating egg hakka noodles and egg fried rice at a time.. Badly missed dessert along with tray! (Dnt mind for extra price..)Value for money and fine ambience.",
