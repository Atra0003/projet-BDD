And importantly good quantity!I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option \ud83d\ude48Extensive...Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian \ud83d\ude48)The good part! Quantity \ud83d\ude0dI was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(The breads and raita were decent!The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step \ud83d\ude48Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases.

        "commentaire": "My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visitsPanko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks \u2764\ufe0f - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.Veg Lasagna \u2764\ufe0f - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.Makhmali Paneer Tikka -Cottage Cheese Shashlik SizzlerItalian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.Cheese and Cheese Pizza \u2764\ufe0f - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!",

Little disappointing when starters are not hot.Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.Veg spring rolls were too good.Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.",

But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!",

Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu.",

So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & \"Italian\" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.",

Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service.",

The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate \ud83d\ude1b( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!Section wise Ratings:Ambience: 3.5/5Staff: 3.5/5Food: 4/5Buffet items: 4.5/5Overall: 4/5",

The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place.",

Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..I was surprised with a Mother's Day cake, complements of the restaurant.. that was a wow gesture.. a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food!!",

Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.Overall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues.",

Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience. However to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.",

This provides several food options in all starters, main and desserts. One the best place to try with family.",

The complimentary starter can be improved..One thing I liked here is the option for vegetarians.Veg starters were plenty ,be it be live counter or the ones served at table.Cajun potato,corn , pineapple,paneer ,kebab are to name a few.All were good.They serve MOMO ,pasta,pizza too in the counters.Main course was nice too and had good variety of curries.Dessert spread was huge .

Maincourse was far better than starters and desserts were also ok. Can definitely visit but not with huge expectations on taste.",

Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast. Fell asleep at 2AM to wake up at 5AM with a severe upset stomach. This went on and when I woke up by 10AM my stomach still hurt. I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555. Their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.",

Of course I have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which I ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. Orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. Yet another incident today where my order was wrong. You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. Guess Zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right.",

Though the restaurant claims to be authentic original Hyderabadi taste the Gachibowli branch was open in 2015. Given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic. It looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. Staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.So for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete NO...Food was okay we ordered Apollo fish starter which was very hard. And spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and Paradise or Pista house has better taste than it. Quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. And it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.I would not be visiting or suggesting this place to anyone.",

        "commentaire": "Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.Ambiance=========Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.Service=========The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.Food=========Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended \"Family Pack\" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the \"Family Pack\" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.Value for Money============All these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.Lets calculate,Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25Final Thoughts=============If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must! Highly Recommended!",

What the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys don't mind to update or apologize.

For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.If you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work ...

The beer had a hint of citrus and a subtle sweet taste. The kothu parotta was a melt in the mouth delicious and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The mushroom was crisp and served as the crunchy element. Our table incharge Keshav ensured that our orders were on time and we had a pleasant experience. Kudos to him. I highly recommend the place for the food, beer and ambience.",

We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!Ambience - 3.5/5Food - 4/5Price- 3.5/5Service- 5/5",

They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn\u2019t chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.If you are in Hyderabad, I will highly recommend to visit this place.",

When I objected,he denied checking the phone. Though the food and place was good,the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude, which cost the two stars.",

Accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best I have had in recent times. Chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao. Goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar.  Sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice-cream  to complete the meal. The setting, food, and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us. After redemption of the Zomato Gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child",

On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!Ambiance===========At the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at \"Panjim\" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.Service===========As we were seated indoors at the \"Panjim\" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.Food===========Ta-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.Value for Money=============Hmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.Lets calculate,Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375Final Thoughts============= If you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! Probably one of the best place to chill out in Hyderabad.",

The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.Tried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.Must try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)Would give it a 4.5/5 just because of the prawns!",

I love the prawns and the sea food, especially the butter friend prawns and the prawn Balchoa. The drinks added for the flavour, I would recommend for a nice evening, but check the reservations before hand, the first time I went had to wait for more than 25 mins. Service is great. Overall a 5 star rating.",

Designed to make you feel like your on vacation, it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me. Different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa,making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation. We had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourful.Mushroom tonak and Mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well. It is the place if u want to try goan cuisine.",

I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said \"Outdoor seating cannot be reserved\". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have \"as per size\" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because \"as per size\" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.Peace\u270c\ud83c\udffb",

During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.Ambiance - 5/5Service - 4/5Food - 5/5Value for Money - 4/5",

It's a huge restaurant with very spacious seating...they have outdoor seating, indoor seating, bar area,buffet area, roof top area its pretty huge place..and every bit of the restaurant is amazing.. Ambiance is spot on...waiters dress code is good too. Service is amazing. They have perfect knowledge of what they are serving..and always ready to help dinners. Hospitality is awesome. But Only one washroom is a meh\ud83d\ude44Coming to the food..i tried many dishes like thai green curry,butter garlic fried rice, stuffed crab, fish and chips, alfredo pasta, cheez garlic bread.I order thai curry every time I go..it comes with rice.. its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistency...it tasted different all three times i tried.. It was good but different. Consistency matters!Stuffed crab is amazing...overall must visit resturant. Its a expansive one but worth the visit..! I sujest night times around 7 is a good time to go.",

The look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise. This place is for friends, family and your loved ones. They have good variety of appetisers.

Even without it, it had the right playlist. The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you\u2019re interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!",

Excellent food and bevs.Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.Fisherman's wharf- such a disappointment.",

As we entered the place, I was just mesmerized by the #beachvibes that it was radiating. The place was already full by 9p.m., but we couldn't resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood. Thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. The food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you Goa trips.",

English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.",

So, I ordered Chef's Special Veg Thali.It contained 3 wheat flour rotis, paneer ki sabzi, daal makhni, salad, pickle, and a healthy dessert!I really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. It was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.Paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. The paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.But I would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. The cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. Also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot.Overall, if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape, eat fit is a great choice. You get calorie count, protein/carb/fat count. You can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days/rest days accordingly.It's great to see that people are so health conscious now. Eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution. Hope they keep inspiring us :)",

Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. No wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. At least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food.",

I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India. Few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 1) They do not use any processed ingredients 2) They do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( That's the real secret for the consistent taste) 3) They use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 4) NO Maida No Sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 5) Daily Cooking (They cook a limited number of portions )and there are various other reasons as well The calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the Indian meals are very tasty especially their No cream Dal Makhni, Nilgiri Chicken, Hyderabadi Chicken, Mangalorean Chicken, Kashmiri Chicken, Tawa Subzi, Paneer gravy in Chefs special veg thali to mention a few. Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day. The healthy desserts, smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos, Wheat Chicken Momos, Chicken Baida Roti are filling. These help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening.The only downside for me is that it's a Zomato Exclusive and Zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery. They promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. By the time food arrives, it's already cold which I hate personally. This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. Zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against Zomato. They have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on Zomato Exclusivity many customers are disappointed Verdict Taste 4.5/5Packaging 4/5VFM 4.5/5Overall 4.5/5Zomato Delivery - 1/5",

The taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times. Except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well. Totally; I am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well.",

So sit back and order online. My order contained 1 Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma and I have regrets over not ordering one more because it left me craving for more. Filled with Hummus and the chicken was just cooked right. It is surely at par with the Shawarma served at Shahi Dastarkhwan, Lakdi Ka Pul. The search for a still better Shawarma continues. My 5 Star rating is still pending for the best Shawarma.",

It was awesome. It was spicy and tasty. Then, I ordered one myself, but I ordered the one with salad. What a slap in the face. I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had. The meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. I relished every single bite. Take a bow, Shah Ghouse!",

Just a 5 mins walk and you could find the big Shah Ghouse complex housing the restaurant, pan shop, tea shop and this Shawarma joint. Lot of crowd and filled with online orders. Delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. Amidst all this rush, I ordered for a Special Rumali Chicken Shawarma for RS 120. Got it in a jiffy and I haven't had much shawarmas before. This was absolutely delicious and filled with Chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. I guess I checked out the reviews here beforehand and I told them to make it less spicy. Don't be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling.  A somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack.",

This is a full-sized dinner-replacement wrap that's bang-on with the flavours. The only shawarma in the twin-cities worth craving for. Do yourself a favour and if you only eat one shawarma in your life, let it be this and thank me later.P.S. The chicken is on the spicier side though.",

The wrap has good quantity of chicken stuffings and the sauce was good too. But once again, the chicken was quite spicy. So if you are looking for healthy food, this shawarma isn't your call. Very fast delivery.",

Hyperlocal is one of the go to places when you have no plans but wanna go to some place to chill, eat and drink.The food is served in matte black plates which is my favourite part.We tried almost everything on the menu (perks of zomato gold) and nothing really was a disappointment.The place looks amazing and has a cost feel.

Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.When it comes to food.First dish was :Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth. Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry. Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area.",

I ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken. I mean how can a restuarant do this. After that I had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order. It took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order. It was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times. On complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check. And at last when I saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered. Horrible experience. I wasted my money time and energy.",

The food pretty decent too, but what I didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. Wasn't happy with the service.Also the live music there wasn't great.",

It's as hard a a rock. Cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread3) Ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me4) DJ was pathetic. It was supposed to be \"Bollywood Hangover\" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.PS: If you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear, unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good DJ. You need feel the pulse of audience.",

        "commentaire": "Review :Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:Full BarNightlifeLive MusicPrivate Dining Area AvailableWi-FiLive Sports ScreeningIndoor SeatingSmoking AreaBuffetIf you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means \"spices\" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.",

        "commentaire": "Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are \"fancier than you are\". \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude42I ordered for \ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf78 Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude1c\ud83e\udd2a in first sip itself. The \ud83c\udf51 \ud83c\udf78 peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and \ud83c\udf44 mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread \ud83c\udf5e \ud83d\ude0b.It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts.",

They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!Again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- \"because its the highest priced drink!!\" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.Be aware people.

        "commentaire": "The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too.The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.Moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for \u20b9 799.They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food.The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.The buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.Golgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down.The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation.Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.The chicken tikka pockets were dry.The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.The music was extremely loud for the place.Overall we had a below average Experience.Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2.5/5",

Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation.

The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)",

        "commentaire": "Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.Hyper Local has introduced the trending \"Drunch\", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.Recommended!!!",

The waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 1+1 for starters. Then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in Hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we don\u2019t speak Hindi. Of course we left immediately and don\u2019t think that will ever come back.",

NOT ANY MORE. Spending 150+ on something like this is utter waste.. IF YOU GUYS COULDN'T PROVIDE ICE CREAM IN PROPER WAY THEN PLEASE STOP GIVING HOME DELIVERY.. despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner. I wonder if I can actually call this as an ice cream. Some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted ..... NOT SATISFIED with your ice cream. . Not worth spending a single rupee on this one.I was trying to take a pic and then this happened. I didn't keep pressure while holding. You can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture. I didn't had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out. Both quantity n quality was not good. I understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate. I place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes. Despite of the distance and presence of dry ice, the ice cream melted completely.",

As the name suggests, they have amazing chaats.I have tried parathas from a lot of places in Gachibowli. And found the perfect places for parathas! But this place not only has tasty parathas, but the price is also very reasonable. The only problem is the packaging. It's not horrible. You can work with it. But comapared to a lot of other places, it is not that great.Aloo paratha combo had two big parathas, pickel, raita and onions. It was delivered hot and fresh! Papadi with dahi was delicious! The curd was smooth and creamy, not at all sour, and had a tangy sauce added in it. The papadis were very crispy and crunchy. It was topped with green chutney.The quantity of the chaat isn't a lot. So, if you're really hungry, maybe order two of these or order something else with it.I'll definitely try their other chaat options soon!Since, I never visited this place, can't talk much about the hygiene of this place! But overall, the experience was good.",

This place is little congested and hygiene is not well maintained.We get all kinds of street food like Chaat, Pav bhaji, Paratha, Chole bhature, Rajma Chawal etc. We had chole bhature and this was the best that I had in the recent times. If you want, you can get extra chole curry. And the butter milk and Lassi here has the Punjabi essence in it. You will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with Butter Milk/Lassi.If you're in search of proper north Indian snacks or street food, do visit and try food from this restaurant. The cost in this restaurant is very affordable. For the quality and taste of the food it serves you will feel that the prices are very reasonable.",

The dahi bhalla, dahi papdi's are good too. However, off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food.Another complaint i had with them are their parathas, they are bad, polar opposite to their chaat dishes. I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha's from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked. This is the reason I have rated them as 3 out 5.",

This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together.",

When it came to having the main course, the options were not many but it suffficed, I would say. The waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies.",

I think it would be better to choose Absolute Barbecue over Barbecue Nation, as customer you get value for money. Seems like now Barbecue Nation is just riding on its legacy.",

They could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine ..... the starters were so yumm that we didn't want to try the main course....

They had chicken tandoori, mutton kebab, veg kebab, American corn, creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff. On the grill they served one variety each of chicken, basa fish, prawn, mushroom, paneer, pineapple. The main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it. The dessert options were sorted and tasty. They had 2 ice cream flavours, Gulab jamun, kheer, brownie, milk cakes, pastries and tarts, 2 kulfi. Over all the experience was very good.Would want to visit again\ud83d\ude0a",

The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. Btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad.",

Chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. It was really amazing in taste. Potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. There was no dish which didnt disappoint.Main course - This is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. All the dishes were really good in taste, usually I skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here I have tried and it was really good. Egg curry, chicken, mutton Rogan all were good. Biryani was also good. Noodles with sauce were delicious enough. It wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.Dessert - My favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. Pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. Kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.Overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. They didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted. Service was top notch as usual and value for money. This outlet is one the best on in Hyderabad hands down.",

The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. The veg starters - Mushroom is a immediate No , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour. Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. Coming to Desserts : Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. Browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it. Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section. I can only rate it 3 for food , 5 for service , 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter.",

When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That\u2019s what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).Not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food. The overall experience was bad, something not expected from a BBQ Nation.",

They play silent English songs in the background.Food-As we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. They served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani. Finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, Gulab Jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.Service-Service was very quick and the staff was very good. Chef himself came to our table to take the feedback.",

The pocket pinch is slightly higher, but it's totally worth it.Then best starters are Cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. All the starters are lip-smacking. Make sure to keep room for the main course.I haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice.Coming to desserts, gal Jamuns are literally out of the world. Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else! Alongside, pan kulfi is a must try. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude2c there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from.Always up for a BarBQue grill \ud83c\udf56",

Ohhh they can't handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up. For sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter, but service time and order time is pathetic.- advance bookings ... They don't understand what means advance booking as soon as u step in- pan kulfi... It should rather be named as sugar syrup topped with milk and green color.

Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.Benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup.",

The buffet was decent though not great wrt variety and taste but the sizzler combo left us impressed with very good portions , perfectly cooked fresh chicken fillets loaded with veggies and garlic sauce. Would recommend the sizzler combo over the buffet.",

They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.Don\u2019t think I would go back there again.",

He then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can't be remade because the kitchen was quite busy. Upon arguing, another person came and changed my sizzler. I had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites. Mistakes can happen anytime anywhere. It's an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers.I would have given one star. But one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler.",

There was no smokiness like the name claimed, just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that didn't really need to be there in it, in the first place. I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). Also, the \"smoked chicken\" needs to be upgraded. The spaghetti was also slightly overcooked.",

After a lot of arguments they finally decided to change it. BUT the story does not end here. They served us ice cold paneer in a different plate. I will just finish my beer and leave now.",

That is what server told us.The server came and took our orders.We ordered starters and drinks.As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.It kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came. The server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.Other places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. Instead he said he cant take it back.Anyways moving onThe cocktail which i had were really good. The cosmopolitan, Beer trap and Screw driver.The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. Italian cheese fingers - They were crispy and yum, Stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the Nachos were okay , have had better ones . The crispy corn was good . Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.The music was good , Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. We four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. He didnt oblige at all.Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? God knows.Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.Hope they improve their hospitality. That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.Food -3/5Service-3/5Overall experience - 4/5 ( Because of friends)VFM- 3.5/5",

There is no separate entrance to the bar directly which means that you have to pass all the people in the mall with your party wear. You may find it little bit awkward.Coming to the bar interior, it is spacious, different seating arrangement, outdoor included. You better book table before reaching, otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends. We booked in advance but still we didn\u2019t get the one with sofa, we got the table with bar chairs(tall).We ordered Singapore Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Wet and white sauce Pasta.Singapore Noodles - 5/5Mixed Fried Rice - 5/5Chicken Wet - 4/5White Sauce Pasta - 2/5They didn\u2019t have pizza on the day we went.Music- They played good English songs early and followed by hindi songs. Songs were very good.Drinks - You have to order through their app. So we had to install and order. It was not very convenient. The price of drinks on the menu in Zomato has no relation with the actual price. Cocktails were very expensive comparing to the one it is shown on the menu.Recommended",

The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous. There are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. Also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience. Trust me you will never be disappointed after going to this place.Ambience - 4.5 out of 5Food - 4 out of 5 (cost could be lower side slightly)Staff service - 5 out of 5",

Half the order doesn't come on time, you'll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time.The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered, too many people are stiffed inside and I don't think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract.Overall, I liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night.

Though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of Nachos, but overall the dish was delicious and worth it.Chicken kebabs: just wow. The best dish of the evening for us. Soft, succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniya-pudina chutney made it worth the money.We also ordered beer, virgin mojito (good) and a pineapple mocktail (very bad - pure waste of money).It also has a good dance place. Furthermore, the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers, to which we grooved until the end.All in all, an awesome experience and I would have given 5 stars, but the pineapple mocktail and the seats that we got inspite of booking in advance made me deduct one star.",

Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla.",

We sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order. Then suddenly being Saturday night, the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side. Everyone want their Saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears. No doubt music played by DJ was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor.Food was fine though but ambience is good.",

In terms of food, we ordered two preparations,Cheese Chilly Toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies.The Lal Special Pizza was not upto the mark. (coming from a reviewer from Kolkata)If you hit the right price, alcohol can be really cheap. We ordered Black Dog Triple Gold Reserve for around 180 INR. It's definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food.",

The veg stack in the western section was actually a spicy paneer which was basically spicy filling between 2 slices of paneer and topped with a chilli sauce. 2 dishes took 40 mins to come while 1 was served in 12 mins. Staff were lost and seemed to be recovering from a late night on Saturday. The only saving grace were the drinks. So unless you want to go and just have a drink and then more drinks, skip the place.",

They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us \ud83d\ude04 We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.Coming to the food:Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!",

Here is the twist of the tale -   instead of refund or replacement, i was only given 150 ruppes zomato credits.

The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole.As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag. The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, Saag was good but lacked salt in it. The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole, a must try and must have at Norfest. The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste.

We placed our order at 3 p.m and they ask us to show the Zomato Gold ID right after 3 p.m (restaurant closes at 3 p.m and kitchen at 3:15), each restaurant seems to have a different policy and we customers should know beforehand what the policy is? We had made it crystal clear that we were Zomato Gold holders and they said we could show the ID later. How is it fair that the staff asks us for the ID after the restaurant has closed and when we could not unlock it!! We are first time users of Zomato Gold.We had to walk out. Horrible service. Stay away from this place if you do not want to be treated poorly by the manager and the staff. Thank you for ruining a special day!!! Why do such places have Zomato Gold partnership? Probably what they're good at, is cheating customers.",

The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which I don't remember unfortunately).The establishment houses two different restaurants (Eat Street and Urban Asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. The service usually is prompt and courteous . Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng. We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. Susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.We would definitely be visiting again and strongly recommend for fellow foodies.",

I found the texture good ! He rates it (4/5)For Main course we ordered chilli garlic soft noodles and button mushroom and diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish .Chilly garlic noodles were cooked with finesse with perfect combination of spices and flavour of veggies .very balanced ! A must to mention is the quantity served , it can be shared by 3 people (4.5/5)Button mushroom ,diced babycorn in oysters sause- this dish is basically fried mushroom and babycorns tossed in oyster sauce that is medium spicy . It blended so perfectly with the spicy noodles .(4/5)I also ordered virgin mojito which comprised of ice and only ice and they charged 160 bucks for that (2/5)Final verdict - authentic asian food with great ambeicne .with Zomato gold it makes it really worth giving it not just one try but visit here frequently !",

        "commentaire": "I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.Main Course -1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.Dessert1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again.",

        "commentaire": "#urbanasia #panasian #delightfulexperience.Well this place is quite an old one in jubilee hills standing strong for quite a long time now. The food here is an absolute delight. When they say PAN ASIAN , they mean PAN ASIAN . The experience of the jubilee hills branch was so amazing that I was being pulled to try their gachibowli branch. And I would love to visit this place over and again, if not for anything but the ORANGE CHICKEN.Food( 4/5)The food here is an absolute delight. No chance is left for any complaint. Good to mention, both the time I have tried ala carte and not the buffet.Starting with the spare ribs to the chilli basil Chiken to the sanghai prawns, all of them were absolutely delicious. The spare ribs is a must try as the same taste quite different from the normal spare ribs, it has a Chinese tinge instead of a continental touch which is taste changer.The aroma of the chilli basil chicken is enough to fill the heart with good vibes. Fresh, refreshing yet light on stomach this item is a perfect starter.The sanghai praws are good, well cooked and a bit tangy to change the taste bud.Amongst all their dishes , my all time favorite which pull me to this place over and again is the ORANGE CHICKEN , which is a must must try here. This dish is an absolute delight to the minf, soul and taste bud. This I believe is the most innovative pan Asian dish which I haven't had in a long time. I call this an innovative dish because no other pan Asian restaurant is able to provide with such a perfect dish with the right mixture of everything.Service (4/5)I believe a restaurant can be surely judged by it's staff.. Here the staff knows all their dishes so well that they are promptly able to suggest you with the right dishes to compliment each other. Kudos to the staff.Ambiance ( 4/5)As urban Asia is a chain of restaurant, we were made to sit at their Indian counterpart as it was a Saturday night and quite late . The interior is quite interesting and has a touch of the rural India in it's decor which I guess is a perfect combination for the Indian restaurant.happilyfoodies.wordpress.com",

The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside. The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming. Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good, the pace of refills needed to improve.I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course. The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that's about it.It's expensive factoring in the food and service you get. These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment. Could give it a try for the ambiance though.",

Serving is damn slow, even though not much of crowd in the restaurant. Price is pretty on a higher side, virgin mojito just tasted as mint lemon drink. We need to ask several times to serve, also when we for main course figured out that few dishes were not served to us which were part of starters, when asked, the same was brought later, Welcome Drink is the one which is served after several remainders and tasted bad. Desserts were not so great and not many. Felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark. All in All pathetic service, you will literally ask 'n' number of times for food which is served on table. Not a wide range of dishes. Taste not so great especially with mock tails.

Actually the consistency was not proper so could not take a bite properly.. Taste wise it was little bland so, there was only cashew taste I could feel..In main course, we ordered Patiala Shahid paneerWhich was one of their signature dish which I was expecting to be good in taste..but again I disappointed with the taste it was normal onion tomato gravy and consistency of gravy was thin instead of creamy..Ajwain paratha and naan was good in tasteMy experience was not so good..plus, staff members were not aware of anything regarding dish..",

Ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient India decorum.When we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. Very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. They were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.Finally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. The order arrived after 15 minutes. Plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. The stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.In main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. Quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. Curry was too ordinary with lot of Curry leaves in it.After having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. Think before you visit this place. And in any circumstance, if you are visiting, beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill.",

Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great.",

Besides EIC, you are also given the menu of Urban Asia and Tiki Shack. It's all in one place. Now dont be surprised if you go there to have in Urban Asia and are given all three menu cards. HAHA!Ok. So there was buffet at the EIC. I scanned thru it and they had very good options. There were number of options. Very intriguing. Though i had \u00c0 la cart. Ambience is very good. You want to go and see whats on every wall, it's interesting. Lighting is good, you get to see what you are eating (i've seen some dont have enough lighting. Not talking about Dialogue in the dark here, hehe). Taste was good, as in ok. I've tasted better biryanis at other places. All and all it was a good experience. Nothing like WOW or Very different. It's a good place, your regular go out and have good food.",

They take there their time to get the food, but thats because they cook it hot right after the order is placed.Overall a good place for family as well as to hangout with friends.",

Food has fluctuating standards here, for a meal that cost almost 2k for 2 people without drinks one would expect at least some good to come out of the most basic cuisines. The kadhai paneer which should have been lip smacking and flavourful was totally bland.The service was so lethargic that I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food on a day when only 3-4 tables were booked.The only positive side of this place is the ambiance which is great, authentic artifacts from the past add a good aurora but the place needs to step up its game in terms of food that they offer.P.S. I was pretty excited about going to this place but unfortunately my experience was so bad that I shall never visit this one again.",

We asked for paneer Kadhai instead they served us with Sauf filled Kadhai of paneer which tasted pathetic. The Zomato gold benefits were denied as the Asian cuisine menu was from the other restaurant of the same owner which was not told to us before we ordered. I missed my outstation bus because of this silly confusion of the management. Overall not a place to go if you want some peace of mind and good food.",

There is absolutely nothing to dine even at chinese side. Dessert section is something you will not feel to have it. You will immediately goto icecream counter where you will wait for 20-30 min and finally that fellow will state we dont have that flavour and can only give butterscotch. Its not that it got over by the time ur turn came, it was never there and they made u wait n finally forcing u to have wht he prepared than wht u want. Finally you will end up paying such huge bucks for drinking water and go straight to office to do lunch at your own office canteen which will look so beautiful than ever before. If u dont want to have food but soend money then its a worth resturant to visit.",

Main course was a disaster, very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten. No panner the main dish, rice items weren't good. Skipped and went to the desert section.4. Desserts was like stabbing a dead man. Nothing exciting, only the ice cream was good.Overall, it is expensive and less satisfying. If you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one.",

We weren't served starters for atleast 40 minutes. The choice of plates and their maintenance is extremely poor to say the least. The food (starters, main course, desserts) tasted so bad that most of us were content just eating curd and ice cream. We will never be going back to this place.",

It had a very India taste to it. They had old locks, keys, doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look. \ud83d\ude0dComing to the food, there is a plethora of options on their menu. Instead of going through it all, we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer. Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination. Corn cubes cannot be missed here. My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though. Moving to main course, we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries. Paneer Lababdar, Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices. Food was decent.The service was not impeccable. It ca surely be improved. Also, they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal. Quite a surprise. \ud83d\ude11The price point is a little on the higher side- probably much more than average. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 It can be a great negative. They accepted gold on food, so yay!Overall, a good experience, but probably not one worth visiting again.",

Now they\u2019ve opened a new branch in Gachibowli. Yay to all my office folks. Everything from the ambience to the d\u00e9cor, to the music is wonderful. The quality and taste of the food over the years has been consistent. I love love love Indian food and they have some delicious dishes if you\u2019re a meat lover. Everything from shorba to kebabs to nalli ki nihari to dum biryani is sooooooo yum!On Sundays, the branch at Gachibowli teams up with Urban Asia to host a special brunch from 12 pm to 3 pm. Urban Asia is another brilliant kitchen for Asian food. If you love Chinese and Indian food, you cannot miss this brunch. They have more than 27 dishes with veg and non-veg options plus desserts. Apart from this, they also had chaat and sushi as well when I went. All this at 888 per person only. What a steal deal. My favorite five dishes from the menu are hara bara kebab, chicken angara, kang pao fish, mutton rogan josh and of course the Dal Bukhara [for those of you who don\u2019t know, this is a velvety makhani style dal that is not spicy but packed with flavor].Make sure to book your table in advance. Another good tip in case you\u2019re someone who wakes up late or you forget to book a table is to go after 2pm cause it\u2019s usually not crowded at that time. Let me know how you like it! Thank me later.",

Has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for Software professionals and casual lunches with friends.I have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that I had a nice time.So in the spread, something that I loved dearly was the Chilly Prawns. I just couldn\u2019t get enough of it. It was amazing.The chicken was alright. But I can say but prawns were the best. Although they were really small, but can\u2019t complain much. They didn\u2019t give us fish even after we asked for it.Staff: attentive and service was okay.Ambience: very nice place, looks good, clean, effort was put in to make it look nice.Food: food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts. They were pretty bad.Complaints: Starting with the ice cream guy- they have a cold stone ice cream. He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream (technically just mixing it) and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away. Didn\u2019t wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop. For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop.Second is also with the ice cream guy, we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately. Lost our appetite soon after that.Third is with one of the waiters, probably didn\u2019t want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu. He agreed to get some but never showed up with it. I hope it\u2019s his memory and nothing else that caused the problem.Hopefully management reads this and takes action on it.If those factors are avoided, then will go again definitely.",

Keeping this in minds we thought a Labonel cake will make her birthday more special.We ordered the cake 1 week in advance and had confirmed the order the previous day. We also spoke to them the very same day we were supposed to pick up the cake. Both the times we were informed by their staff that the store is open on 23rd Sept. till 6pm (this is after you ignore the fact that their official timing is 7pm).They decide to call me on the day of pickup at 4:50pm to inform me that they will shut down at 5:30pm. So, not only was i expected to drop whatever i was doing at a moment's notice i believe they expected me to teleport to their store.Well since the cake held sentimental value for me I did leave immediately and rushed to the Gachibowli store. I made it there by 5:10pm and can you imagine my dismay when I saw that the store was closed! To add to it no one answered the phone.I stood there for 30 minutes trying to get in touch with them on multiple phone numbers on the website but there was no response.I could not believe that a renown place could be this unprofessional. If they cannot value their customers and have no regard for others time and sentiments I do not think it would ever matter how their product is.My sister no longer considers them a role model as she values her customers more than having a fancy store with expensive products.Since they did not contact me back even the next day I feel the only option left then is to complain on social media and hence this post. I hope this falls on deaf ears of Labonel owners.I know I will not be repeating the mistake of ordering something from this place and to anyone who reads this, you have been warned :)Update: I have a facebook post which certifies that minimum 5 friends of mine have dealt with similar bad experiences.",

        "commentaire": "Although, I have not been spoken rudely to by anyone working at this place, I can very well believe the negative experience many others have written about. Hochn\u00e4sig is a word that came to my mind when I visited this place the first few times. Hoch is high and n\u00e4sig comes from nose. This German word can be loosely translated to snobbish or haughty, but these words do not describe my impression of them as well as \u201chochn\u00e4sig\u201d does. However, that is not all they are. They are in fact one of the best bakeries in Hyderabad and one can very well understand where their pride comes from. I said one of the best and not the best for three reasons:1.    This place is expensive.2.    Except for the cupcakes and brownies and occasionally the chocolate cake, everything must be ordered at least a day in advance.3.    They don\u2019t sell cake-slices. You must buy the entire cake, which you must order in advance.Now coming to the gooooooood stuff\u2026Brownies:The best I have ever had! The chocolate is rich, deep and the brownie itself is light, moist and almost melts in your mouth. I know some of you may say that that\u2019s not how a brownie is supposed to be, that it is supposed to be dense and gooey and you may be right. BUT, try this one for the flavor and its melt-in-your mouth quality.Chocolate Cakes:I have tried one of their Classic Chocolate cake and Triple Chocolate cake. All the chocolate cakes are made from the same batter as the brownies, so each one of them is rich, moist with an excellent, deep, chocolate flavor. The best one is clearly the Triple Chocolate cake.Carrot Cake:To me there are two kinds of carrot cakes. One is the desi kind that you get at Parsi bakeries, which is moist, dense, has khoya/mava and cardamom even. The other kind is the fancier, videsi version, which has nuts (mostly walnuts), cinnamon, a cream-cheese frosting and is drier. Labonel being a \u201cfine baking\u201d place naturally has the latter kind. Although I am not much of a fan of this kind because of the cinnamon, which in my mind always over-powers any dessert, Labonel\u2019s carrot cake is the best I have ever had in this category.Cheesecakes:I have only had one of their cheesecakes, blueberry I think. It was a right amount of fluff, fat, sweetness and flavor. The base was delicious too. However, the cheesecakes at Eclat or Chili\u2019s are slightly firmer, hence a bit better.Cupcakes:Cupcakes are their only product that I am not a fan of. They are too small, the frosting is a little too soft and in my opinion add no value to cake. You can give the cupcakes a complete miss.Cookies:Choco-chip, Double chocolate and white chocolate/raspberry and the only 3 kinds they bake. Soft, rich, moist, chewy and yummmmmmm\u2026Miscellaneous:There are some seasonal cakes like the honey cake or the plum cake. The honey cake is ok, but the plum cake is so loaded with rum that it can make a teetotaler a little tipsy.Overall, if you don\u2019t mind spending a lot and are a cake fan like me, then don\u2019t give this place a miss.",

Rs 700 for box of brownie which will last for 4-5 days, per brownie it costs ~50. Good deal for a group of 6-7 people however not so good deal for single person/loner. Place an order in advance for assorted box of brownie. Suggestion: I don't want to go and eat chocoLava in Dominos on cheat day, instead i want to have Brownie here. Why not offer a single piece or small one person box (3-4 pieces may be).",

Classy outlet as well, with very foreign inspired interiors.Their chocolate chip cookie is very good (chewy and tasty).The honey chocolate cake is a good bet for your evening snack.The cupcakes here are my all time favorite (choclate feels better than the red velvet)Their brownie is also one of the best in Hyderabad and is quite a good option for gifting people as well as being a recepient of such a box of delight.",

It's just walnut kismiss cake with cinnamon flavour and maybe carrot somewhere. And of course cream cheese frosting. There were simply too many kismiss in there. I hated every bit of that cake.I have had few other chocolate flavour cakes from here and they are an absolute delight. 3.5 rating is because carrot cake has spoiled it all. How much ever I say, it will be less compared to my feelings after eating that cake.",

So yesterday the occasion was right  and I was in the mood to splurge and enjoy some quality stuff with my SO. Unfortunately, I was utterly disappointed with the service that they had to offer. The staff at Labonel don't know anything about customer service.They were very rude and mean to us. I wanted to check their catalog but the person was behaving as if I was there to steal their products. Very impatient and unwilling to help. And also their phone number never works. Tried calling several times and never got a response. Anyways coming to food. I only ordered assorted collection of cupcakes The price burnt a hole in my  pocket. Only 15 tiny cupcakes for 850rs. The flavors are vanilla, chocolate and red velvet with vanilla and chocolate frosting. I tried the vanilla and chocolate so far and I  can say that chocolate cup cake is just fine, nothing special or out of the world experience like some other reviews claim it to be. Vanilla cupcake was dry and tasteless. Yes it was like eating a sponge(I am not saying that the cupcakes was as soft as a sponge it was as tasteless as a sponge). Nothing but just hype . I have had better cupcakes for a lot less money in small bakeries.  Final note: Never ever  going to visit the place again. Overrated place",

I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes.",

Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time. We also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. Want to try everything in the menu in future. Keep up the great work!! Will definitely recommend.",

Very ill professional employees who cannot guide their costumers properly to their place. They have great quality in what they serve but zero in how they serve. My whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. I have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. I was okay with it and said I will collect it from their store. I almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, I reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time. I kept giving them information about how far I am and that I would reach them in less time. I requested them to wait for 5 minutes as I was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. They answered my call at 9:00 when I was near GVKONE. I said I will come in 5 min they said they will wait. But, by the time I reach their place everything was locked. I called them 100 times and their was no response. What an awful service..! If you have a big party, please don't rely and order anything from this place. Worst experience..!",

This cup cake box has 3 varieties of mini cupcakes: chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. All the three varieties were baked to perfection with extremely soft, airy and moist sponge with this luscious and velvety icing on top. They are definitely at the top of their game right now.P.S. the icing was a bit sweet for our personal taste.Previous review:A class apart, fine baking luxurious bakery in the midst of all the hustle bustle. Labonel holds a very different, sophisticated yet very pleasant aura. All this while I avoided this sweet gem coz I assumed it's hell expensive (considering cost for two stated as 3000) but that's certainly not the case.Because I was in a hurry and dint have time to try, test and enquire about all the items, I quickly picked up a box of chocolate brownies. Heavenly, decadent, sinful, melt in the mouth, luxurious, delectable, delightful....I can go on and on raving about this piece of art. I do like to clear the air about misconception of Labonel being shockingly expensive coz it is not. A box of 15 brownies with utmost quality for 650 and 15 cupcakes that too with three different flavours for 800 is more than a fair deal, coz once in a while your sweet tooth needs extra pampering ;PWith Suvi Kanchan",

This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.But the negative point is that they don\u2019t have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items.",

You have a triumph thunderbird LT on one side with it's massive round headlights and a ducati monster on the other side in a dashing red. There's great music playing and there's riding gear, etc. hanging off the walls with numbers to call in case you want to rent some of it. I went in early morning around 8:30. The cleaning lady was still sweeping and it was kinda hot inside (ac switched off probably). There was no one behind the counter. Asked the cleaning lady and she shouted out for someone who came right away and took my order. Ordered for a mint mocha and a cinnamon roll. The guy was coughing randomly (hopefully not into my food or drink), but I found this to be an annoyance. I mean, you can have the fanciest of ambience but if the people who serve there aren't trained in basic hygiene and cleanliness, it all goes to waste. The mint mocha was superb and the cinnamon roll was ok-ish. As I paid, I got a torn note, so I gave it back (to exchange it of course). Instead the guy just took it and went away. I waited for a while, then called out. Asked for my money and instead of one note, he handed over two. The dude was clearly in his sleep - probably having been through the night shift.Giving the rating only for ambience and quality of food. 1 point taken away for the serving attendant. Oh, and they don't have anything non-veg.",

We had ordered veg pizza- loved it, loaded with cheese and veggies with super thin crust. Four cheese pizza- I didn\u2019t like it that much, made up of four types of cheese with super thin crust. Veg sandwich- nailed it, it was the most yummiest one for me. Paneer sandwich- my friends loved it, I don\u2019t eat paneer so I can\u2019t say that for myself. White sauce pasta- it was good, more veggies to it would have made it perfect for me.Coming to drinks, I ordered cool blue slush and I loved it taste wise , another reason being, it took too long to sipped up fully.Overall, it was a good experience for me.",

We ordered chili cheese toast, chocochip brownie and chocochip cookies. Except for the cookies, nothing was good. While the brownie tasted like some kind of medicine, the toast was just too hard and very difficult to chew.",

My suggestion would be to increase the snacks options and adding some exotic desserts like sizzling brownies.",

If you look closely the tables on first floor are actually made up on car and truck parts as well! Too much innovation and thinking, is just mind blowing. The wall next to stairs full of pictures is most photogenic. The cherry on top is their songs selection.All the coffees taste great, especially the fact you get it even after midnight. Although my personal favourites are Flat white and Cappuccino. The quite bites available as Paneer Kulcha is recommended as well. Don't forget to take good camera along with you while going here.",

Their luxurious collection of supercars and bikes includes fantabulous FORD-MUSTANG-5, premium PORSCHE-911 CARRERA-4S0, the Hulk of Bikes TRIUMPH-ROCKET-III, speedy SUZUKI-HAYABUSA and the kinetic KAWASAKI-ZX14R- which is also one of the world\u2019s fastest bike to name a few and guess what one could also rent these amazing creations from their website. At present, their fleet consists of 150 cars, 50 motorcycles and 7 bicycles.If this doesn\u2019t satisfy the gearhead inside you then there\u2019s some delicious food and coffee for killing your hunger cravings even in those odd hours of the night!The place is a brilliant amalgamation of a cafe and a bike museum. The ground floor of this establishment is a quaint cafe which sells food and beverages. It is very vintage in feel and decor and you will be treated by a very well spoken staff. The cafe also has a store which sells/rents biking accessories including biking jackets, helmets and other accessories.Coming to the food now, the first thing we had here was the Chili Cheese Toast which is a cheddar melt on white bloomer with an orange mayo. It was quite filling and really tasty. Next up was the flavourful Apple Pie with ice-cream that totally melted in mouth and tasted heavenly with ice-cream.This was complemented with a selfie coffee and a regular coffee. The \u2018selfie coffee\u2019 has your selfie printed on the coffee foam purely made of edible ink. This is one-of-a-kind experience. You click a selfie and Whatsapp that on a number, they\u2019ll print that particular selfie on the coffee.Lastly we had the Turkish Baklava Twins which were crunchy, nutty, flaky and really delicious. The place has a lot of variety in terms of coffee which included Colombian Coffee, Death Wish, Illy Monka, Birch Coffee, Araku Tribal Coffee, Organic Decaf Peppermint Mocha and many more.The place is definitely a must go!Review Credit: Karan Bhyanachiclifebyte.com",

Has an American cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 AM at least. The cheese garlic bread, veg puffs and Latte coffee were pretty good. It's self service and the order came in pretty quick. One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. Overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite.

The products tasted real good.I feel the cheese \ud83e\uddc0 on my mouth when I was having the cheese melt wrap. Chicken was tender and cooked real soft. They are boneless and hence facilitated smooth process of eating them. Wrap was cooked equally good.Reshmi Chicken Kebab Wrap was awesome. It gave a different taste altogether.Highlight was the rice though the wraps were equally good. Rice was cooked with real long basmati rice and the masala mix was at the right proportion. It can be had by both - children and elders. They have two differential cooked chicken on the top. Both are boneless and cooked with perfection. Only the ingredients differ.My tummy is full, this noon :)",

Honestly, my excitement dropped down after tasting the parathas, as they were too greasy. Paneer curry, on the other hand, was the savior, Vadas were fine and Kheer was up to the mark. What I liked about the thali was that it had more than enough food for 1 person. I am going with 2 stars as the parathas are the base of this thali and I couldn't finish even half of it. I have very high expectations from Fassos and am sure they will take this feedback well and improve on the quality of parathas.",

It gives you a feel of both wrap and pizza and tastes amazing.The size is big and is good enough as a meal for one personI have also tried chola kulcha and Veg thali from Faasos but in Bangalore,they were also very good.I have tried almost all of their major wraps :Pizza Wrap (5/5)Mac n Cheese wrap (4.5/5)Cheesy corn Salsa(4/5)Aloo wrap (3.5/5)Jumbo Veg wrap(3/5)Egg wrap (3.5/5)Paneer Tikka Wrap (3.5/5)Rajma Chole is also very good.Desserts:I recently tried their Red Velvet cheese cake and it was also mind blowing and definitely worth a try!!It was one of the best red velvet cheese cake,I have ever hadRed velvet (5/5)Raspberry Cheesecake shot(4.5/5)Chocolate Fantasy (4/5)Must try their wraps and especially Pizza wrap!!!",

When you order a pizza roll.. they not only bake it like a pizza but they take it to the next level of master culinary skills... They roast it till the end.. just like how your mumma used to make it.. and best part comes next.. Faasos excels in giving surprises and since they handle their own delivery you can never know when your food is going to arrive... It's too much fun to see that status - \"Food is being prepared\" , \"Your food is in the kitchen\".. and they won't update it because the delivery person can come any moment to your doorstep and say Surprise.. In my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes... So fast da.. then I remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes... I asked delivery person why so much late da.. He said sir we were cooking your roll property that's why it took time.. open it and try it sir.. you would have never seen such roll.. And he was right.. I never saw the roll only charcoal.. ( attached picture for reference )",

Everything tasted good just that the makhni didn't go with the meal. There could be rotis as well and the portion of khichdi cud be decreased. The taste was no doubt best. Fasoos has been doing great in terms of bringing the festivities and food together.
